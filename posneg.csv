"Staff was excellent, and even though under significant renovations the place was very well kept.",pos
The lighting in the room as poor.,pos
The bathroom was cold and needed a heater or separate thermostat.,neg
The motorized blinds freaked out at 7:00 am and started opening and closing.,neg
The complementary bathrobs were worn out.,neg
One couch in the room had a hole in the coushion.,neg
There was absolutely NOTHING that I could say negatively about our stay!,neg
It was all good!,neg
The spa and downstairs restaurant were closed for renovation,neg
The rooms are looking rather tired and just don't compare with the quality you find at Langham's other properties.,neg
All dark brown wood and dimly lit.,neg
Very much four star and lacking the wow factor.,neg
I had a view onto a brick wall.,neg
The lobby is cramped with the bar up stairs.,neg
Nothing - perfection.,neg
Did not make up our room until 5pm each day which was when we had returned from our day and wanted to have a rest before going out again.,neg
Quite unfriendly entering and leaving Hotel with no greetings most time.,neg
We had paid in full with Bookings.com and when we were leaving they charged our credit card another night which appeared on our credit card statement with out saying anything about the new charge.,neg
Whilst they acknowledged it was a mistake after my phoning from Australia they still have not refunded the money and it has taken me another  three phone calls from Australia.,neg
Not good enough for such a large chain.,neg
Everything was excellent,neg
The room had not been cleaned properly.,neg
There was a hairband on the bed.,neg
A towel with makeup stains in the bath tub.,neg
The toilet had not been cleaned and the bin was not emptied.,neg
"I did not have time to raise this with the hotel, I am sure they would have sorted that out if I had as they were very helpful with everything else.",neg
I expect it was a one off mistake and not normal.,neg
- The king size was fine,neg
the sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable with a very thin mattress and springs that made the 2 people in the bed roll towards the middle.,neg
5 sleepless nights that come rather expensive !,neg
"- the ""fully equipped"" kitchen didnt have anything to heat up water for tea !!",neg
"no kettle, no pot, not even a bowl or a teacup to go in the microwave
- Although there were 4 of us in the suite, we got 1 bathrobe and 2 pairs of slippers.",neg
They were stingy even with the TOILETRIES !,neg
"We got 1 bottle of shampoo, conditioner and boda soap and no refills during cleaning service, we had to specifically request them !!",neg
- only 1 rather pricey F&B option,neg
Having to leave!,neg
I guess the towels could have been  softer.,neg
I'm really having a hard time thinking of what could make it better.,neg
"no info to guest regarding no serving of breakfast at breakfast room, was closed for private event
expected a delivery, they said nothing arrived when it was delivered
pick up at the airport La Guardia, very bad organized, had to stay outside for ten minutes waiting for the car",neg
"- Not great amounts of space for storage/clothing - one wardrobe only, could do with more cupboard room
- Beds a little soft for our liking - purely our preference
- Baths/bathroom could do with rubber mat as can be slippery getting out",neg
The Spa and Gym were closed during our visit.,neg
"Gym and spa would have been nice to have open,",neg
this will be available early January and only add to the hotel.,neg
I asked for views and had a building en face just a few meters away.,neg
"some areas of the rooms are a bit dark, especially depending on the room",neg
I had a small issue with drop off service ending so early,neg
I guess its understandable.,neg
"The bell boy was very gracious and hailed me a cab without any hesitation, I would have preferred a little more on the late night menu",neg
I guess its understandable that the over night menu be so limited.,neg
A staff member entered into my room to refill the mini bar which was a huge shocker being that I was in the nude and had prepared for a late check out.,neg
And I did not like the general feeling of insignificance upon check out as I was  struggling with my bags and it seemed the staff couldn't give much concern.,neg
Almost as if saying we got your money now who cares.,neg
Not a fan of the walk of shame approach to a departure.,neg
bad dinner referal by concierge.,neg
Not to our liking.,neg
Maybe just not our kind of restaurant,neg
Cant believe the restaurant is Michelin star quality.,neg
"Very expensive, poor service and average food.",neg
"No gym, spa or downstairs bar/lounge",neg
advised its all being re imagined!,neg
!,neg
It would have been nice to have the facility to make tea although it was available in the lobby.,neg
The windows were dirty,neg
is not that easy to fix 14 floors up.,neg
Only advised Spa & Fitness Suite closed for refurbishment 2 days before arrival.,neg
On the last evening there was no hot water for over 12hrs from 7pm until 8am due to a block issue .,neg
Nevertheless would have expected some offer of compensation given the Rating of this hotel.,neg
A bit pricey,neg
you definitely get what you pay for.,neg
"There was a little bit of building noise , which was ok",neg
woke every day by drilling which started at 8.15 every day,neg
Construction at facility.,neg
"Its expensive,",neg
not out of line with other luxury NYC hotels,neg
We had a discounted rate as the faciltities were being upgraded including the pool and the business centre,neg
"Bath plug did not work, so no baths.",neg
"Housekeeping was informed,",neg
no response.,neg
During our stay there was some renovation works taking place and this resulted in some of the public areas of the hotel not being open.,neg
"- single control of night curtains
- light in the walking closet could be better placed",neg
Nothing could be improved,neg
Amenities such as water boiler is not there in the room.,neg
"No teas available, only coffee.",neg
Pullout couch in living room wasn't very comfortable.,neg
We had our nanny with us and that was not the best for her,neg
it wasn't the worst either.,neg
The staff were very accommodating setting it up and putting it away for us daily.,neg
"The staff is unfriendly, seems especially if you took advantage of a Booking.com discount.",neg
There were instances where they were just straight up rude.,neg
"Don't expect a ""good view"" since most windows are super dirty because of pollution and construction work.",neg
(you can't even take a photo).,neg
"Don't expect them to be very accommodating if you complain about this though, you'll at most get offered a wine bottle or ""free"" breakfast at their Michelin star restaurant where a buffet is $36 per person and includes the same variety as a budget motel (some bagels and fruit).",neg
housekeeping poor and inconsistent.,neg
they used bleach products on crockery.,neg
towels not clean and quite worn out.,neg
not enough lighting in room at night.,neg
bed was awful - mattress very thin and no proper support in the base of the bed and mattress.,neg
concierge recommendations for eating were poor and ineffective in sourcing tickets for baseball game which were easily available on line directly,neg
Spa was closed.,neg
The breakfast buffet was very good and of excellent quality,neg
a little variation each day would perfect it!,neg
"(for example different pastries each day, variation in ham and cheese)",neg
Very few supplies in the kitchen however once we asked we were brought up what we needed right away.,neg
This did not detract from our overall stay.,neg
The only down side was the reason we booked the hotel because I was in Atlantic city for one day on the Saturday on a stag do.,neg
I wanted a hotel so my partner could use the spa facility's and pamper her self whilst I was away.,neg
But due to maintenance was closed.,neg
We was not aware off this until we checked in.,neg
The buffet breakfast could have more choice,neg
they do also have breakfast a la carte!,neg
Nothing to complain about!,neg
Concierge kept recommending their own restaurant which was not that great.,neg
Also did not correctly make the only 2 reservations we requested from him.,neg
Spa was closed and no pool.,neg
Nothing at all.,neg
I'll be back here exclusively.,neg
The only pitty was that the hotel was being renovated.,neg
So the Spa was closed.,neg
But we didn't have any problems because of it.,neg
We knew when we booked that there will be renovations.,neg
Rooms expensive.,neg
Restaurant should offer discount to residents.,neg
Plug hole in bath would not shut to run a bath.,neg
"Of course, a little pricey.",neg
"But other than that, there was absolutely nothing to complain.",neg
Nothing,neg
Price can always be cheaper ,neg
Shame the spa was being refurbished,neg
probably wouldn't have had time to use it anyway!!!,neg
,neg
Breakfast expensive at $32 each.,neg
Spa and bar were being renovated so no facilities at the moment apart from Al fiori restaurant,neg
"External signage is too discreet looks like Park Ave apartment block not hotel,",neg
that may be the intention!,neg
Lobby didn't feel like a 5 star.,neg
"Some of the furniture showed some ageing (scratches, stains)",neg
the hotel is currently updating their rooms to resolve this.,neg
"Nothing, it was all amazing!",neg
"The lifts were often busy,",neg
that was not a serious inconvenience.,neg
"The room is just a bit Spartan in decor, compared to other Langham properties",neg
The bathroom while gorgeous could have been cleaner.,neg
I felt compelled to wipe down the countertops on my own.,neg
That I didn't stay longer.,neg
nothing.,neg
Didnt have the breakfast because I thought it was too costly.,neg
Everything in the room is for sell considering the price of the room.,neg
"All good, definitely ideal for 20's, 30's more hip crowd.",neg
"Bathtubs didn't drain well during shower, pillows too soft, mattress not the most comfortable (lumpy)",neg
The property is showing signs of aging and nothing is being done.,neg
In the room the furniture was chipped.,neg
"In the rooftop lounge, the same.",neg
"The Exhale Spa was the worst: Towels had threads coming out of them, shower walls were slimy.",neg
No functioning water dispenser available.,neg
The carpets were showing wear and tear.,neg
"Overall, not the type of experience I was expecting.",neg
We did not like Exhale.,neg
"We booked massages and the spa is in a dark, dingy basement and overall has a very poor ambience, especially for the price.",neg
There was no music or soothing sounds during our massages.,neg
We heard people talking and walking and staff banging around outside our massage room etc.,neg
Not relaxing at all.,neg
The hotel rooftop is very popular at night.,neg
It was very packed so guests that want to enjoy the night scene may prefer to opt out.,neg
Very expensive room service and mini bar.,neg
A bottle of still water costs 9 USD.,neg
Way tooo noisy!!!!!,neg
I wouldn't stay here again bc there was a room party going on next door to me and although I asked the front desk to address it - the party continued and I couldnt sleep until the music and yelling stopped at 4am.,neg
I would have appreciated the hotel taking care of this better.,neg
Now I know.,neg
I would NOT recommend this hotel,neg
I didn't like the hotel security.,neg
When coming in at nite they picked and choose who they were checking for room card .,neg
Either Check everyone or no one .,neg
Based off that I won't be staying here again... this have me negative reviews for  my stay based off that..,neg
For $300 a night the room was extremely smaller than a cheaper hotel would have charged.,neg
I feel the estimated value towards it was because of there being a highly priced mini bar.,neg
Mini bar and water in room expensive.,neg
Everything in room had a price tag on it.,neg
Bar was quite pricey.,neg
"Bed was a bit too firm for me, got a bad back.",neg
Didn't get the room I wanted .,neg
Not sure if it was the booking agency or hotels fault.,neg
Didn't get back to my last email .,neg
Whatever,neg
Bar didn't make great cocktails and the waiter was rude and uninterested.,neg
Rooms are close to needing a refurb and the AC is noisy,neg
Everything was a horror !,neg
"- the American breakfast took too much time to come to the table - the eggs tasted like meat a dirty grill 
The hash brown were soak and refried in old rancid oil -  took it to the Front desk -  they couldn't agree more - - I requested they take off the breakfast I could not eat - they did oblige - 
My husbands eggs were not over easy and the white of the egg was loose / - disgusting !!",neg
Health dept needs to go to that kitchen,neg
"Probably only drawback was across the street, the ongoing construction, which due to Thanksgiving was slowed.",neg
"Also, we were on the 4th floor and one night, a Friday?",neg
we could hear either the lobby action or the PH music and partying --,neg
not bad enough to interfere with good sleep.,neg
"The wellness consist only of a sauna and it was a bit old glory, needs a renovation",neg
Loud music from club on roof and bar until 2am Friday and Saturday night.,neg
Disturbing even on 3rd floor.,neg
Guest next door had several people in room with music until 2.30am Sat night- soundproofing poor and corridor noise penetrates rooms.,neg
Building work opposite starts 7am Weekday mornings.,neg
Restaurant on site disappointing.,neg
The brunch menu was very limited.,neg
A couple of things we disliked.,neg
"- The room was tiny, which we expected for NY",neg
this was by far the worst we've been in.,neg
The furniture was too big for the room which made the room even smaller.,neg
- The bed was small and old.,neg
My husband is 6 foot and his feet hung off the bed.,neg
They put a mattress pad on top to perhaps hide the old mattress and the creaky wires.,neg
Did not help.,neg
The worst 3 nights sleep we've had.,neg
- You had to step all the way into the bathroom - practically over the toilet to just shut the door - which is absurd.,neg
The shower head is unmovable.,neg
It's in one spot and you can't move it up/down or around.,neg
- They had no nice amenities.,neg
Everything was an advertisement.,neg
"Shave Club, a goose for your pillow, coffee, Fiji water all over the place etc etc.",neg
I've been to swankier hotels and they at least provide toothpaste.,neg
Even Hiltons provide this and a mending kit for goodness sake!,neg
- The room had a huge wall sized picture of people sitting in what appears to be the bed in the room.,neg
It was unpleasant and the last thing you want to see in the middle of the night when you wake up - life sized people staring at you in black and white.,neg
- It snowed overnight and we left for brunch at 11:30am and wouldn't you know that not one spot was shoveled around the hotel?,neg
11:30 am and nothing done.,neg
- The rate for this hotel was too much and I know we got a great deal on it.,neg
It was about 300/night and these apparently go for 650+ a night for the same room (it said in the closet it goes for $713).,neg
I can honestly say that 650 is a joke if that's what they charge and 300 a night was also a joke.,neg
This hotel is not worth it at all.,neg
I would never pay 300 a night again for it.,neg
"If anything, $150.",neg
I will never stay here again and will never advise anyone stay when going to NY.,neg
I was really disappointed because I thought this would be a really nice treat around the holidays to stay somewhere swanky.,neg
Paying for coffee in the room.,neg
There was no indication about this until we were billed at checkout.,neg
It should have been put on the list together with the other products that we could have bought.,neg
We've never had to pay for similar room coffee in any other hotel.,neg
Lobby not very warm or welcoming at night.,neg
Even cafe for breakfast was freezing and draughty.,neg
Could be because of cold snap in NYC,neg
even so it was too cold to hang around.,neg
The staff in the upstairs bar was rude as was the woman at the downstairs bar.,neg
Parker on the other hand was awesome.,neg
"It would have been great to have a king size bed, especially because it was so comfortable and the pillows were the best.",neg
The other major item in my book was the clear windows that were two way.,neg
I like to leave the shades up for light and you could see straight into the room.,neg
I didn't realize that until the second day so some folks might have gotten quite the show.,neg
The staff are liars and thieves!,neg
"Most, especially the girl in housekeeping are rude and unprofessional.",neg
It was quite difficult to get a drink in the bar.,neg
Being a roof top bar it was very popular with non guests.,neg
it would have been good if there was a bar or small area for guests only to relax,neg
It was very dark in the rooftop bar.,neg
"The shower head was adjustable in height,",neg
it wasn't mounted high enough on the wall.,neg
"Rooftop bar with shared lift access so lifts often busy and noisy
Having to provide proof of room key to get past hotel entrance.",neg
"Very busy bar on ground floor, obviously a local hangout",neg
not so good if you are resident.,neg
Cons :Charged for room coffee and no notice stating it wasn't complimentary.,neg
Bathroom shower leaked all over the bathroom floor after each shower.,neg
Only leaves one coffee cup in the room.,neg
Poor liquor selection at the hotels bars.,neg
"Dark room, poor lighting.",neg
TOO CROWD ON THE WEEKENDS !!,neg
!,neg
"Bartenders unfriendly, rooms small with no drawer storage, shower curtain has big gaps and blows in on you, took 1 hr plus to get some ice, neighborhood is all under construction and feels deserted, food was inedible at the bar and room service, room service tray not picked up timely.",neg
"That the room is like a shop, everything has a price tag attached.",neg
":( hotels this quality and standards should give their guests free bottled water & coffee, instead of selling small bottle water for 9$!",neg
It spoils it.,neg
Also we were visiting  from Europe and only for 2 days &didn't have an American adapter.,neg
I always can get an adopter at the reception (even for a deposit) at any other hotel (+ complimentary water & coffee in the room),neg
of course had to purchase one at Gansevoort.,neg
:((,neg
The room we'd booked (a suite) wasn't ready our first night.,neg
Disappointing.,neg
A toilet in our room also ran constantly - even after an attempted repair.,neg
Everything's for sale --- so much in room marketing gets annoying.,neg
"There's no ice on each floor, you need to call room service for ice.",neg
"The rooftop bar is great, too great.",neg
It's a hopping night club which draws lots of visitors.,neg
Not good as a hotel guest.,neg
Great when I was a part of the chaos!,neg
"1. clock was still on daylight savings time and couldn't change it
2. coffee pot didn't work
3. the one station we wanted to watch at 10PM didn't come in (Sunday nite football)",neg
Too noisy outside couldn't sleep till five in the morning if you're looking for a good night sleep that is not the place to stay if you're looking to party all night this is definitely the place to stay,neg
"I got a fairly good rate on this discount site, if I'd paid full price for a room I would have immediately complained.",neg
"I was also only there to sleep for one night, again, any longer and I would have asked for a refund.",neg
The room was tired and old - the table had a massive crack in it.,neg
The sofa was discoloured and gross.,neg
"The bed was not made properly,the duvet the wrong way up.",neg
The plastic sheet under the sheet was very disheartening.,neg
"Went to the rooftop for a drink during the day, and the pool area was closed despite being told on the website it is open year round.",neg
Had a gin and tonic which cost a fortune and was flat and served in a plastic glass.,neg
The view was amazing!,neg
But blocked off by a sheet of Perspex glass that is so cracked and old we struggled to see through it.,neg
"All in all, if you are getting a really discounted price then fine.",neg
"However if not, avoid this place!",neg
!,neg
"The beds weren't the most comfortable,",neg
not bad.,neg
hotel has a nightclub that turns it into a zoo on weekend nights.,neg
"music noise, outside crowd noise and constant honking of cars trying to access hotel went on until 3:15 pm",neg
"Shades in room not dark enough for morning bed springs hard, fan in room sounded like a wind tunnel",neg
Very tired decor and furnishings.,neg
Staff inattentive.,neg
It all needs a revamp if they want to get away with such high prices.,neg
Street noise- car/ taxi honking constantly at night until 3 AM.,neg
The hotel is old and tired and much needing a facelift.,neg
Soundproofing is not good so the nightlife surrounding the property can't help,neg
disturb any kind of sleeping.,neg
Especially bad because of Halloween partying.,neg
The room was extremely dusty and looked like it had been several weeks since a proper clean.,neg
All surfaces covered in dust.,neg
Toilet bowl stained.,neg
Small bottle of water in the room 9 dollars.,neg
"All of this not good,",neg
the sound of the night club vibrated through the room until almost 4 am.,neg
On checkout I raised the issue of noise and was simply told if it was a problem then should have called at 3.30 am to pack and move room.,neg
This is the Meatpacking district!!!,neg
Overall the lobby and elevators was full of drunks during the evening and the management need to decide if they are a hotel or a night club.,neg
In years of visiting New York this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.,neg
The roof terrace in the morning looked like the party had just ended.,neg
No effort was made to clean up the space so guests could take a morning swim.,neg
Stay away much better places in the area.,neg
"Mini Bar was expensive
Several of the light fittings were loose on the walls",neg
"I understand comments about paying for extras in room,",neg
prices clearly marked so you can just ignore fripparies - essentials are free.,neg
"Didn't like the club atmosphere here, very noisy at night esp when club closes and the drunks spill out into the street.",neg
One night when we returned from dinner a man outside hotel offered my daughter cocaine.,neg
Noise at night from 3rd floor was loud.,neg
Around 11 every night someone started playing a congo drum or something.,neg
Not really condusive to sleeping.,neg
At times a bit noisy around the hotel (esp.,neg
in the wknd),neg
The staff was not very personable.,neg
I think they weren't very well organized and they appeared to be way too overloaded with work.,neg
Will not stay here again.,neg
"Rug smelled heavily of chemicals, air conditioner did not work well, bed not very comfortable, room was high priced, not a great value",neg
"- pool was very cold, sauna was tiny
- strange that the doors, elevators, and pool bar all had bouncers",neg
"gave us a room that had no a/c for first night, then when a/c was fixed had aweful smell of mold or mildew, obviously something was wrong with the system in room, asked to be moved 1st night",neg
"had no available king rooms, sent bottle of $19.00 wine for inconvenience.",neg
thought for the price it was poor,neg
"The rooftop pool is supposed to be heated year round,",neg
"it wasn't, so that was disappointing.",neg
There is complimentary coffee and tea from 6 am to 7 am which really is too early and should have extended hours.,neg
I booked a king deluxe room thinking I would get a king size bed.,neg
Wrong.,neg
the bed was probably not even a queen and my husband being a big guy who has trouble sleeping to begin with this was awful.,neg
"I know we were upgraded and had a patio,",neg
as I told the front desk upon checkout we would have rather had a more comfortable bed!!!,neg
!,neg
Basic hotel for what it was.,neg
Roof bar was run by a separate company so they didn't care who went up.,neg
"We left when on Sunday night a huge group of drunk party goers disturbed our quiet evening, while we paid the same price for a drink....which was expensive!",neg
$9 for water in the room that is $3 in Duane Reade is disgusting and exploitation.,neg
Staff did not orientate us to where things were in the hotel until we asked for specific items.,neg
Gym - tv on treadmill didn't work...basic gym.,neg
I needed to call reception for hairdryer...not in room and it was pretty lame.,neg
Downstairs bar staff were rude - not friendly at all.,neg
I left an item in the roof bar when we left having been disturbed by drunk revellers and the item was then not in lost and found.,neg
Brand new item.,neg
"First impressions were good,",neg
very quickly we were aware that this was overpriced and not that high quality.,neg
Sunday afternoon we left to get some lunch and a girl was puking in the street in the restaurant next door.,neg
No staff escorting her away from the main display of the hotel.,neg
Disgusting,neg
We were told that the Bar at reception was run by a different company.,neg
The bar staff were not great and service was poor.,neg
I think this impacts on the hotel and its name.,neg
It was very much a party hotel and the bar facilities down and on the rooftop were geared towards the general public so it didn't feel exclusive.,neg
"Also, breakfast was served in the bar area in the mornings which was not really nice.",neg
"Other that this, everything else was very good.",neg
The gym Equipment needs some work also.,neg
Otherwise the rooms were great and the location was great.,neg
"Friends were treated poorly at rooftop bar, Plunge.",neg
They were sitting at a table that didn't say reserved.,neg
They weren't asked to move nicely yet told to get up.,neg
We paid $1000 for two rooms and were drinking $20 cocktails.,neg
That was unacceptable.,neg
"Also, told my friend that the sheets for the pull out bed were an additional charge of $50!",neg
Kind of crazy being the room was labeled for three people when booking.,neg
"The staff were polite and pleasant overall,",neg
there were a couple of questions we asked for help with that we did not get thorough answers on.,neg
"The hotel was EXTREMELY loud-- at 2 or 3 am, all of sudden the people in the room next to were playing very loud music and I could just hear it through the wall like it was paper.",neg
"The next day I was there, there were 5 fire trucks down stairs at 2:30 am.",neg
Didn't sleep very well during my stay.,neg
Room Service was awful.,neg
Lousy service and food.,neg
"Busboy brought a Ceasar salad to the room, in replace of the fried chicken dinner that consisted of 3 drumsticks and no white meat, without a cover on it and than proceeded to drop the tooth pick from his mouth into the salad.",neg
Disgusting!,neg
Didn't like the toiletries for sale on the desk.,neg
"One had been used and surreptitiously closed to appear unused,",neg
you could see it was only half full in the light from the window.,neg
"A bit off-putting,",neg
housekeeping could not have told by a cursory look.,neg
"I don't like surfaces being jammed up with stuff for sale and folks are just self indulgent and cheap so this stuff happens, I guess.",neg
The pillow were too soft for me......didn't really sleep well.,neg
Some of my family thought at night the location was too loud as it's very busy with nightlife activity!,neg
I had ear plugs so was t bothered.,neg
"Very, very noisy at night.",neg
Parties start around 11pm and go to 3am daily- if you are a light sleeper don't stay here.,neg
Broken glass tabletop caused a bleeding cut.,neg
Management were concerned until we assured them we weren't going to sue.,neg
No view even though we paid for a suite which advertises a view.,neg
Noisy all night long even with the windows closed.,neg
Downstairs bar is disappointing for such a great hotel.,neg
Downstairs restaurant was consistently empty.,neg
The hotel seems to rest on its location/hip reputation laurels somewhat!,neg
The rooms are exceedingly noisy at night due to poor or non-existent double glazing in a location associated with all night revelling (still awake at 4-5am more than once!!).,neg
The in-room dining number was permanently engaged to the point of being totally unsatisfactory (I didn't get through once in over 3 days!!),neg
"and the prices for food, drink and accommodation are top end.",neg
Beware the hotel policy for pre-charging extreme amounts on your credit card.,neg
"My daughter was robbed in the restaurant (The Chester) that adjoins the
Gansevoort.",neg
The Gansevoort security said this is a common occurrence.,neg
"We
will never go back!!!",neg
!,neg
The extreme numbers of people using the roof top pool and the noise made in the room corridors throughout the night - every night !!,neg
EVERYTHING in the room had to be paid for - I.e.,neg
"No free shower gel etc., No water - They charge $9 for a bottle in the room !?!",neg
?,neg
I had to dispute an overcharge on my credit card for something we did not consume from the honor bar.,neg
Made me angry that when I called the hotel I was told too bad and had to involve my credit card company to get my money back.,neg
"WiFi was hit and miss
More fresh fruit at breakfast would have been appreciated, we had just apples on all 4 days
$15 charge for toiletries when you are paying £250 per night (we didn't use them!!)",neg
There is construction site next door to hotel.,neg
Air con/heat fan could not be turned off in room,neg
Would have been nice to have fresh fruit at the free breakfast,neg
"The bathroom had been updated with new  tub, and hardware recently.",neg
"But there were a few signs (like chip in the tub, and peeling facade under the sink ) that said a bit of attention would be called for.",neg
"Also I didn't find out that a discount for Veterans was available,",neg
only if asked for at the time of registration.,neg
suite was noisy.,neg
Perhaps gluten free choices for breakfast - there were only cornflakes and no bread products,neg
Breakfast could have had more healthier options!,neg
"Would have liked a kettle in the room, not just a coffee machine.",neg
Felt the hotel offered nothing special and,neg
was clean and presentable,neg
There is a large construction project happening next door .,neg
Work starts early in the morning.,neg
We were woken up by loud banging and general building site noise .,neg
A large apartment block is being constructed and looks in the early stages .,neg
For this reason we wished we had booked some where else,neg
Nothing,neg
Construction work on the street not informed by Booking.com.,neg
No discount for the inconvenience.,neg
"Good breakfast,",neg
"no bacon, eggs, ham, etc.",neg
"Old windows, no good noise isolation.",neg
"The breakfast - could have been better more choice ie hot choice fried breakfast, scrambled egg etc, didn't like the takeaway plates.",neg
Breakfast was poor.,neg
Weren't  informed about renovation therefore  no restaurant.,neg
Rooms could do with a refurbishment.,neg
Cleaning in our suite was patchy,neg
Not having construction outside.,neg
The rooms with 2 beds are very dark and have a very drab view out the back of the hotel - no options for the front.,neg
"after check-out, we checked our bags in order to spend a little extra time in the city before leaving.",neg
"When we returned to collect our baggage, we were directed to the rest rooms which were quite impossible to find on the 2nd floor from the stairs.",neg
I was told there were easier to locate via the elevator,neg
they were both unavailable so I gave up trying.,neg
Better signage from the stairs would be helpful.,neg
Not really anything to complain about.,neg
"As expected, breakfast was very basic toast and pastries, we ended up going out for breakfast each day.",neg
Only a minor thing (we ate out most meals) only 2 chairs at dining table.,neg
No lobby with coffee and kosher snacks,neg
"Noisy outside through the night, I guess this is to be expected in the city that doesn't sleep!!",neg
They could do with emptying bins in this area during the day and doing financial district at 2am!,neg
Internally made worse by being next to the lift.,neg
"To be fair, this impacted the person sleeping on the sofa bed in the lounge much more than on those in the actual bedroom.",neg
Perhaps some signs asking residents to be quiet when leaving during unsociable hours might help - not really a criticism of the hotel more other residents - people heh!?!,neg
?,neg
The room used for breakfast is way too small when the hotel is busy.,neg
Our family ended up having to either sit apart to eat breakfast or sit out in the lobby around a low table.,neg
In the check-in I was told the parking would cost me 50% plus because my car was a regular Cherokee.,neg
"I argued this was not said during the reservation, and the car was a regular size.",neg
I was advised I had to discuss it with the parking staff - in a very unpleasant way.,neg
"However, at the end, the parking charged me the regular price (I didn't even raise the topic).",neg
"The breakfast is extremely poor (no cheese, no fruits, no eggs).",neg
There is no place to sit (only a few tables).,neg
No staff to even apologize or pretend they cared about the inconvenience.,neg
"Finally, they posted a (still pending) extra charge in my credit card (after telling me everything was paid at the check-out), and never returned my calls to clarify to what it refers.",neg
"The noise of the building site right next the hotel at 7 a.m. 
Breakfast should have more options :eggs, cheese, ham, etc.",neg
Construction work next door didn't detract from experience.,neg
"Best to get a room towards the rest of the hotel,",neg
"Very poor breakfast, the double charge of my account for two weeks, lack of wellness, just too expensive for that service",neg
The obvious and only real challenge was the small and modest breakfast space and offering.,neg
But plenty of bread and pastries.,neg
However lacks enough tables for number of rooms.,neg
Restaurant for breakfast is very small and could not accommodate the guests.,neg
Very little available items for breakfast,neg
The breakfast area is very small and crowded at peak hours.,neg
Fortunately there are plenty of eateries in the neighborhood.,neg
The road noise was immense.,neg
3am rubbish collections woke us.,neg
There is a construction site next door and work begins at 7am!,neg
The breakfast room is badly organised and ends up in a bun fight!,neg
Too small breakfast room.,neg
"If U R lucky, no need to wait,",neg
typically the room is full,neg
Didn't like the plastic plates / cutlery at self service breakfast & unless you timed it right there was no seating left - very small dining area.,neg
Be prepared for 4 types of tax added to the bill!!!,neg
!,neg
"Breakfast room bit busy, especially over weekend, could do with a little more space",neg
free breakfast was more than adequate.,neg
"Rather small bathrooms,",neg
"they are still ok. 
As many other people reported before, the breakfast room is too small for the size of the hotel.",neg
At around 9am it can get very crowded.,neg
More personal during peak hours for breakfast would also be appreciated.,neg
"The food is ok, only sweet things to eat",neg
for a few days this is ok.,neg
Otherwise there is a diner across the street.,neg
"Until 2018 there is a skyscraper being built just next to the hotel, which comes with the associated noise starting at 7.30am.",neg
If you have a room away from the construction site it is not as bad as you would think.,neg
Breakfast was so so.,neg
Did not get the info up front that the parking would essentially triple in price if we left the garage late.,neg
"We pulled in at 0900; left the next morning at 1100 and instead of charging us $30, we were charged $90.",neg
Total rip off-- the guy at the garage had asked us on arrival what time we'd be leaving and never once explained we'd be charged more.,neg
Breakfast had very few options--bread mostly.,neg
Found additional $75 charge on our credit card after leaving that was also unexplainable.,neg
"Unfortunately, there is a massive building contraction has been carried out, which makes constant noise.",neg
I would call ahead if you have a young child and need a portable crib.,neg
The crib we were given looked like it was from the 1940's.,neg
Complete with Scotch tape holding two rods in place.,neg
But my main issue was the bedding and bumpers were very thick and plush.,neg
Current parenting advice says this is dangerous and if my daughter had been 12 months or younger I would not have been comfortable with this crib bedding.,neg
"As it was, my daughter is nearly 19 months and I did not ask if a more modern crib was available.",neg
But it would be a deal breaker for parents of an infant.,neg
"San Carlos is a great hotel, so please hit eBay and upgrade the hotel's portable cribs to the 21st Century.",neg
"The street was very noisy due to construction, it is a one-way street with hotels across the street as well, so lots of horn beeping even at 4:00 AM due to blocked street.",neg
Major construction including excavation drilling from 8a to 5p every day.,neg
Painful.,neg
But out of the hotels control.,neg
"Very limited brekfast area and very limited selection, would expect more from this type of hotel.",neg
Had to wait several times to get seated.,neg
Construction work next door was noisy,neg
ended in due time in the afternoon and can hardly be blamed to the hotel,neg
"Location , too far from the action !",neg
0,neg
shower a bit disappointing .,neg
"Continental breakfast ok helped start the day ,",neg
gets very busy and too few tables for amount of guests.,neg
Hotel should have a service elevator as lifts always busy with service staff in the mornings .,neg
"There was no bar or proper restaurant within the hotel, which was a shame as they had nice cosy spots to sit in the lobby & on a mezzanine floor.",neg
The continental breakfast was ok,neg
only plastic cutlery & crockery.,neg
No decent cereal or English tea.,neg
A massive skyscraper is being built just next door (and they'd only just started on the foundations so it will be a good 2/3 years before its finished) so we were woken every morning around 7.45am with the sounds of Jack hammering & drilling.,neg
Breakfast room could have been bigger.,neg
Vary the breakfast as was repetitive.At the moment noise of the building work next door.,neg
"The breakfast was only toast, rolls or buns with some fruit.",neg
Not even peanut butter.,neg
Very disappointing.,neg
"Continental Breakfast was, surprisingly for the class of hotel, rather a bun fight in a small crowded room and limited choice.",neg
"The breakfast was a little late in starting, and I would have liked a cup of coffee in the lobby beforehand,",neg
these are small things.,neg
Drilling next door for a new property,neg
that's not the Hotels fault!,neg
!,neg
"For gluten free travelers, breakfast is a bit limited (yogurt and fruit).",neg
Very little interaction from reception or door staff.,neg
On arrival and leaving we had to drag our bags in and out of the hotel and load and unload them.,neg
This is a group of three women aged 55 - 60.,neg
The door staff just stood by and watched!,neg
There is a new building being constructed  next to the hotel which was very noisy from 7am not good if you are on vacation and this will continue for a couple of years,neg
Breakfast without cheese or meat / vegetables ( only sweet things).,neg
More than sufficient,neg
not healthy.,neg
"Construction works nearby, which wasn't too bad because we were out most of the day",neg
There was limited rooms with 2 queen beds so we had no view at all.,neg
There were air con machines outside our windows which gave some noise,neg
tolerable.,neg
There was building work next door which was loud at 7am,neg
we used it as an alarm clock for us!,neg
This only occurred on last two days of stay,neg
work will go on there for months as it is a building site at present.,neg
Soundproof = 0 and there was on-going construction right beside the hotel.,neg
"We were not able to sleep at all during our 8 day stay
Eggs and more varied fruits could have been included in the breakfast",neg
The breakfast room was shabby and the plastic forks and plates did not correspond to the hotel.,neg
"I went down for breakfast at 9.30, the room was untidy with peoples' left over breakfast and there was not much choice.",neg
The business lounge was uncomfortable to work in and noisy.,neg
We were also suggested an Italian restaurant by the staff which was atrocious.,neg
The continental breakfast was poor quality.,neg
Could not drink  thecoffee and space was limited in sitting area.. (Had to wait for a seat and tables not cleaned)This was rated as a 4.5 star accommodation and do not honestly feel that it is more than a 3.5 at best.,neg
"In short, overpaid!!!!!",neg
!,neg
"The location is just between key areas, so you are not quite in one of the key tourist slots.",neg
On the other hand all is easily accessible.,neg
The fridge temperature gauge did'nt appear to be working properly.,neg
N/A,neg
"The breakfast is really just coffee, bread/pastry and yogurt,",neg
that still  provides a nice and convenient savings with Manhattan prices.,neg
"decor all a bit tired, bathroom basic, couldn't get the wifi to work in the room, inclusive breakfast very limited",neg
Had 6 people in room and not enough toiletries and towels and pillows and supplies upon arrival.,neg
Had to call for everything.,neg
Nothing,neg
Sofa bed,neg
that was our fault - it's a sofa bed not a bed!,neg
I booked the hotel bc of the rooftop bar which was closed for remodeling.,neg
I was disappointed not to be told ahead of time or at least to be compensated with a token free drink in the cafe or a gesture of good will.,neg
The staff seemed somewhat indifferent.,neg
Not in any way unfriendly,neg
not engaged either,neg
The roof bar was undergoing renovations which was a pity.,neg
The room was really small.,neg
Was not worth the money.,neg
The night staff was very rude.,neg
Mainly the front desk lady.,neg
The bed was not comfortable.,neg
The rooms are all small..don't be fool by the pictures.,neg
We where upgraded to a king room with a view due to the rooftop bar not being open whilst we where there.,neg
However the room seem to be the same size with a partial view so I would have been disappointed if I had paid extra for this room type.,neg
Nithing,neg
"Our room was not clean when we arrived, there was hair and tic tacs on the floor, the blinds were very dusty and we found holes in our bedding.",neg
It seemed that when we complained they did remedy the situation quickly,neg
these things should not of occurred in the first place.,neg
We were denied access to the roof top bar due to a private function and they had a rude and frosty reception at the bar in the restaurant.,neg
"The towels varied from having two each to five each, most days the bathrobes dissapeared and we had to request new ones.",neg
Location was not great as bit of  trek to subway and not much to see or do locally.,neg
Had room service one evening and it was a very long wait and food was cold on arrival.,neg
We stayed 5 nights in Dec 2016 and our bill with local taxes was almost £2000 for me and my daughter.... Would I stay again ....Probably not,neg
The bed was too soft for my liking.,neg
We were on the 14th floor.,neg
The wind caused a whistling which was very noisy.,neg
Water pressure in shower is poor.,neg
Not very hot either.,neg
Sink didn't drain very well.,neg
Lobby area isn't really conducive to sitting around.,neg
Rooftop doesn't open until 5pm.,neg
Very few common areas to sit in.,neg
The bathroom door didnt seal properly therfore the floors were always wet.,neg
Someone came in to fix it,neg
it still kept leaking.,neg
Minor niggle kept knocking our shins on the corner of the wooden bed frame when going round it......but no complaints!,neg
!😊,neg
"Room was very small even by NYC standards, front of house staff were not overly friendly or hospitable during our 5 day stay
And I was particularly disappointed & revolted that our bedding & sheets were not even cleaned/had not been changed from the previous guest on the evening of our check in.",neg
"We discovered this as we were about to go to bed at 11pm and as no one from house keeping was there, the front desk staff simply sent me clean sheets for me to change them myself.",neg
"More space to store suitcase/clothes, space very limited.",neg
"After running the marathon I would have liked to have a hot bath, shower only in our room (good shower though).",neg
The staff where never interested in us as guest.,neg
They seemed not to care much about a family visiting the boutique hotel.,neg
I am used to be met in a more friendly American way which is always nice.,neg
We were very pleased with the hotel and have no dislikes to mention.,neg
"The rooms although stylish are very small and the bed was extra large which is good in some ways,",neg
it was easy to bash your legs on the corners of the wooden bed frame as you moved around the room which was very painful.,neg
We have order at booking that we need a room for 4 people (2 adults and 2 Kids).,neg
Booking presented a room with a king size bed where the hotel could put two extra beds for the kids.,neg
We additionally inserted a comment about in booking.,neg
When we arrived at the Hotel they just sad that the room we have booked does not offer space for additional beds for the kids.,neg
It was a very desapointing experience for us to try to get another room for the role family with no additional costs.,neg
- Price of drinks at the hotel bar.,neg
"- Private event's in hotel bar...no access for guests
-You are unable to reserve an area for drinks unless min 6 staff and you m ust email the bar manager, reception could not help with this.",neg
The reason we booked this hotel was the rooftop bar.,neg
After a extremely stressful journey to the hotel we just wanted to check in and have a relaxing drink on the rooftop.,neg
Check in was fine and then decided to make our way to the bar.,neg
Once there it was more like a nightclub experience.,neg
This actually happened on numerous occasions throughout our stay.,neg
We even went up one early evening to be told that we couldn't use the facilities because of a private function.,neg
We were there a week and the two times we wanted to use the bar we were turned away due to private events.,neg
The rooms are very small too and was hard to juggle suitcases and our things with two people.,neg
"When booking too make sure you take into consideration the extra charges for NYC as what you are quoted for the rooms and what you pay on checkout is very different, it is there",neg
in the small print.,neg
Not much storage,neg
Hospitality appalling on arrival.,neg
Very misleading pictures showing spacious rooms when in fact we didn't even have room for our suitcases due to lack of storage.,neg
"Paid extra for ""deluxe"" room which we didn't get and when queried was told ""deluxe"" means you get a room on floors 17 or 18 with a view (the view was a factory roof!!!)",neg
the rooftop bar was nice,neg
"small , cramped and well overpriced in my opinion.",neg
It created issues getting in the lifts with all the people who were non resident visiting the bar.,neg
I did complain as it was my wedding and Richard was very good,neg
bearing in mind I paid a lot of money and it was my wedding overall I was very unimpressed .,neg
Wouldn't recommend or stay at this hotel again.,neg
"2 groups in our party including my wife and I had to be moved rooms on the 18th floor due to horrendous noise (only giving us 3hrs sleep) from the heating, plumbing and ventilation system.",neg
"We were told this is a regular problem which beggars belief with the amount of money it costs for a ""deluxe"" room.",neg
:-(,neg
The noise of other guests going in and out of their rooms is painful to say the least.,neg
We were on level 11 and I would hate to hear what it was like on level 16 to try and go to sleep with the rooftop bar pumping.,neg
Everything was perfect,neg
Not as much to do directly around the hotel,neg
close enough to tube stops to get around easily.,neg
Preferred staying in this quieter location and travelling in to the hustle and bustle!,neg
Personally the location for us was no good.,neg
"If you want quiet , you're in the right place.",neg
"If you want to visit a few bars in the evening, you're looking at the wrong place!!",neg
The rooftop bar at the hotel had its own special aroma which wasn't great and it was over priced.,neg
"Ordered (and prepaid) for a king bed room,",neg
got a twin bed room.,neg
The staff told us that they were over booked.. A bit too pricy compared to quality and facilities.,neg
I think you will get more value for money at several other NYC hotels.,neg
With all my previous hotel reservations on bookings.com - you only pay after your stay,neg
"in this case, as soon as i booked our 2 nights 7 months before - it then mentioned that the fee might be deducted instantly - which in my case it did and it was not ideal!",neg
"It was my first visit to New York & although Hotel Hugo was well equipped, beautifully decorated & vibey with friendly staff, i feel it was a bit too pricey for the area & the size of the room.",neg
Our room was situated on the 5th floor (Hotel has 18 floors) and offered a view of the adjacent UPS building's brick wall.,neg
"For 2 adults & a child in a small room with 2 double beds, we kept knocking our legs badly on the sharp wooden corners.",neg
It was very cheeky to place a bottle of water next to the bed (which in my experience it is usually complementary),neg
here it was as an extension of the mini bar with a $6 price tag.,neg
"With my South African Rand things are very expensive as it is traveling to the States i could have gotten a hotel room close to Central park, Park Ave or close to Time Square for the same price range on bookings.com.",neg
"sections of rooftop bar area smells like old spilled beer.,,, coffee maker in room never worked.",neg
Otherwise fabulous experience,neg
"Maid service was very average, we had to ask for non-decaf coffee, clean glasses, towels etc.",neg
Had to order ice (you couldn't access it yourself) so could take quite some time to get delivered.,neg
Sometimes bed was not made properly.,neg
"Small things,",neg
small things make a difference.,neg
Expensive restaurant (breakfast and dinner).,neg
"The rooftop bar means that there is a huge queue for the elevator in the evening, along with a crowded lobby.",neg
"The shower was a bit weak and I left a pair of shoes which I tried to get back by calling over the couple of days after we left,",neg
didn't get a call back.,neg
Nothing,neg
The room we had was pretty small - not easy for two travelers with suitcases.,neg
Bed was excellent,neg
wood under it a little too big for the mattress so we did get some bruises on the legs.,neg
Not being able to use the stairs to the lobby - had to use the lift at all times.,neg
"No plug in bathroom sink and even after reporting this to front desk, plug never appeared.",neg
The beds were small,neg
comfy.,neg
We requested some more milk for our coffee,neg
never got it one morning.,neg
"Upon check out at 5:30am, desk clerk told me to catch taxi at corner....with my luggage.",neg
"Doorman came out and helped...luckily, a nice guy.",neg
I have stayed at this hotel many times.,neg
I stay there primarily because of the price and the location.,neg
I have three primary issues with the property.,neg
The first is the poor plumbing for such a new property.,neg
In the sink one can get either hot or cold water,neg
not a mix of the two.,neg
One has to get completely wet to turn on and warm up the shower due to poor design.,neg
The second issue is the poor elevator service when rooftop is busy.,neg
the third is general cleanliness,neg
"Bit on the small side, view of the UPS depot, few lifts so they take a long time to come if it's busy.",neg
For a four stars a lot of little details are missing in the room to make it really cosy.,neg
"No supply of small kit for the bathroom with shower cap, cotton pad....",neg
"When we arrived, we had no shower gel.",neg
If you need something you have to call all the time the reception.,neg
Room cleaning was done at random time and we had to chase the first few days for having the room made up.,neg
Also we were really surprised that room service is closed after 11pm which I particularly find strange as main purpose of room service is to be able to order a bite whenever (not talking about having an extensive menu,neg
at least few quick options available all the time),neg
"Small rooms are a given in NYC, so closets to prevent your stuff from lying on the floor would  certainly help",neg
"The area around the hotel was not very clean,",neg
you never felt unsafe in this area.,neg
Design of the room wasn't great i.e.,neg
"No drawers to put clothes in (only drawers were 3 inches deep), difficult to turn on shower before you get in (break you back to lean in to turn the very stiff handle), bed has extended edges so you bang your shins a lot, plug too far away from dressing table so the hairdryer doesn't reach.",neg
Just not a very well thought out space.,neg
"Also, when roof gets busy in evenings, there's quite a long wait for the lift for residents and the people going to the roof got priority, leaving guests waiting even longer.",neg
Housekeeping!,neg
"This was generally sloppy for my entire stay - laundry that should have been same day took 48 hrs,  I had to ask for my sheets to be changed",neg
"Also, the two lifts are used by staff and people heading up to the rooftop bar so for guests staying in the hotel, waiting for a lift from the lobby or your floor can be a long wait!!",neg
"All in all, not the best stay in NYC, I wouldn't return and wouldn't recommend!",neg
The roof top bar was more of a priority than the guests.,neg
The bar was closed regularly for private parties.,neg
"Sleeping on the top floor, just underneath the bar the bar was noisy at night and sometimes the bar guests were directed via the eighteenth floor.",neg
There were only two lifts so late afternoon and through the evening were so full of bar guests residents had to wait for ages for the lifts to arrive and then were full.,neg
"Not a criticism as the rooftop bar is absolutely amazing,",neg
it would be great if hotel guests could buy drinks and snacks at the bar before it opens to the general public.,neg
Check in took forever.,neg
Only 2 elevators obiously isn´t enough!,neg
Dark hair in the batroom upon arrival.,neg
Location is nice and calm,neg
feels a bit OFF though.,neg
Fire alarm went off 3 times our 2nd night at 2 a.m. What a horror story!!,neg
We started to pack!,neg
"!No info, no nothing afterwords!",neg
Not good!,neg
!,neg
A drunk rooftop guest setting off the fire alarm at 2am!,neg
But the hotel offered something for the inconvenience,neg
People having private parties in their room which made the floor noisy.,neg
Took them an hour to send someone to look into it .,neg
False fire alarm at 2:00 am .,neg
Release of credit card debit takes them 10 days .........,neg
There was a lot of noise coming from the elevator.,neg
Overall the room was not very quiet.,neg
You would spend a lot of time waiting for the elevators of which there are only two.,neg
This is in part due to the amount of outside people visiting the rooftop bar.,neg
I was surprised to find that the minibar was not restocked every day.,neg
the staff missed one full cleaning and didn't even apologized for it.,neg
general level of cleaning was not up to normal standards.,neg
Very noisy air con and very hard pillows.,neg
Being told rudely that we weren't able to use the roof top bar due to a function,neg
then being told we could.,neg
This was handled poorly by the staff member.,neg
The design of the room is impractical.,neg
"the draws only open 30%, the closet has no lighting,the one bright light over the vanity does not allow you to see well, the groove on the sink collects water right were you plug in your cell phone and finally the toilet seat was broken and they had to replace it.",neg
Small room on 2 nd floor.,neg
View of hotels mechanics.,neg
Friends traveling with us had large room 15th floor great view.,neg
Was ours because we booked through booking.com?,neg
communication between staff.,neg
Rooms were nice/modern,neg
a little clinical,neg
The roof: it was not that big as came from the pictures.,neg
"the outdoor was limited to  few meters, the area is mainly open only for happy hours events and no services during the day.",neg
The price: it came 400$ per night thai was willing to pay to get the roof service and given that it we not the case for the same price you can get a better located place in the heart of  Soho,neg
There were frequent disconnects between the Guest Services and In Room Dining staff.,neg
Some of our orders got mixed up and were incomplete.,neg
staff was far below average.. not cooperative at all and we constantly had issues.,neg
"toiletries weren't always there , we had to also change room as the one that we were given upon arrival had a dirty bathroom  ( hair probably fro.",neg
"the previous guest, on the floor and on the toilet seat) .",neg
"However, we were given immediately another room and a complimentary breakfast.",neg
Worst situation though was on the day of our departure.,neg
it took 40 minutes to get our invoice corrected from the reception and the car service we ordered from the hotel was delayed as the hotel messed up the arrangement with the car company.,neg
The shower was not the best as the shower head was a little clogged.,neg
We wanted to spend time on the rooftop bar,neg
they had the top deck closed and a private party on half of the floor that was open.,neg
"The restaurant attached, we ended going there before our flight as it was the nearest and it just fit in with hotel.",neg
It's really formal Italian food which was very expensive for what it was.,neg
In room items were expensive-I know they are expensive,neg
when they are double what you'd pay from a local shop you feel there taking advantage a little bit too much.,neg
Everything is uncomfortable.,neg
The air conditioning system must be cheap as the sound it produces leaves you no chance for sleeping.,neg
Opening a window is also not an option as it is facing a huge UPS warehouse working at night.,neg
"Trucks roaring, people shouting, etc.",neg
"The blinds are all out of order, you have to call a technician to close them.",neg
And no way you can turn on the water in the shower without getting all wet and cold.,neg
Maids talking loudly since 8 in the morning right in front of your room with a don't disturb sign.,neg
"The pillows were incredibly uncomfortable, too stiff and thick,",neg
"I was barely at the hotel to complain or have them changed, so I can't judge the staff response to this, as I didn't complain.",neg
The HVAC would only shoot out cold air.,neg
"The room doors let in way too much noise from the outside hallway,",neg
"luckily there were no late night noises or drunk people, as in other reviews.",neg
Room not serviced until late in the day - once maid was there when we returned at 6pm.,neg
The location was 3 block from the closest subway entrance.,neg
"The weather was very cold, so I was limited in some activities unless I wanted to take a cab.",neg
This hotel would be perfect for mid spring through early fall.,neg
rooms felt a little dark and didn't offer much of a view.,neg
paying for a superior room I would have expected to have a bath.,neg
"Staff were unfriendly, noisy air conditioner, smelly room, uncomfortable pillows.",neg
Staff were unable to provide extra blankets as the housekeeping room was locked.,neg
When I checked out I wasn't asked to check the itemised bill before it was charged to my card.,neg
I could hear the music from the rooftop bar in my room (I was on the 16th floor and the rooftop on the 19th) - it wasn't too distracting in the end because I was so tired!,neg
Rooms were a little small to be sharing.,neg
The rooms need a clock and a coffee maker.,neg
Room was dark (7th floor).,neg
Next time I would get a higher room,neg
"Door staff not great
Not being able to ring room service direct or have a room service menu was a nuisance.",neg
No hotel info in the rooms.,neg
The Bedford Room is too small for two.,neg
"Maybe for one or two days is fine,",neg
not for a whole week.,neg
"Staff...you can have a wonderful and supportive help from them, or they can be totally indifferent, which is not appropriate for being part of a hotel staff.",neg
"We had some issues with the bathroom, they fixed it,",neg
no one later came to check how the room was left.,neg
"In summary, I liked it,",neg
they have room to make some improvements.,neg
"Food average breakfast 80 dollars rip off
Size of room couldn't swing a cat
Had to live out of suitcase no storage 
No fridge 
No water in room 
No kettle in room  no iron",neg
"No suggestions, we were very happy with this hotel",neg
I was in a handicap room that had a shower curtain as opposed to a shower door.,neg
The curtain needed to be longer to prevent water from splattering and getting water on the entire bathroom floor,neg
"Bed was short, no coffee maker in room, very inconsistent security at front entrance",neg
"The price is a bit high, and so I've stayed here only twice, on ""off"" weekends when the price is a better value, because typically there are other hotels of similar quality for a better price.",neg
"Still, if you get a reasonably good deal here, it's well worth it in comfort and exquisite quality.",neg
It is the best hotel experience I have ever had in Manhattan.,neg
"We stayed for 15 nights over Christmas and New Year - the front desk staff were unbelievably aloof and uninterested, in fact almost unhelpful.",neg
One receptionist was pretty hostile!,neg
"The rooms would benefit from better designed storage, as there was practically nowhere to store anything",neg
Excellent location.,neg
Great shower.,neg
Super dark and dusty small rooms.,neg
It's not good to have carpet if you are not willing to hoover it properly.,neg
"Rooms tiny, heating fans are loud,  had to turn off for sleeping.",neg
"Amenities weren't replaced every day, sometimes I just ran out of shower gel.",neg
"No sound protection at doors, every noise comes into the room from corridors.",neg
"Elevator malfunctioned for a day, it was dangerous, I reported three times while it was repaired.",neg
Front desk staff wasn't as nice and helpful as in Jade times (hotel's former name and brand).,neg
1,neg
"On december 31st, I left my necklace on the desk in our room as well as the second door key that we had.",neg
We spent all the day out and we came back at night the necklace and the second were gone.,neg
"Instead, we found on the desk another necklace that did not belong to me.",neg
"We informed the reception about what happenened and left the necklace we found, their response after two days has been, we have no evicence of what really happened and you have to take the responsibility of what happened.",neg
"As a ""courtesy"" if we can say, the hotel offered the return to the airport and one dinner that we had in their restaurant...",neg
"In any case, this does not compensate the loss of the necklace.",neg
The decision taken by the hotel is not commercial at all and legally disputable.,neg
2,neg
We did not find the hotel staff devoted and friendly in spite of what some comments can say.,neg
Not professional.,neg
3,neg
"The rooms very small, dark and not well equiped to put luggage and stuff.",neg
Our room was also very badly sound-conditioned.,neg
"In the end, in our view the hotel is over estimated and too expensive for the premises and service you get in return.",neg
We do not recommend this hotel.,neg
It would be good if there were special offers for guests who return.,neg
Room was a little on the warm side.,neg
"Couldn't control it with the thermostat,",neg
"on the plus side, you could open the window!",neg
"Cleaning ladies were laughing and screaming at each other, impossible to take a nap.",neg
The rooms' doors slam and its impossible to sleep at night,neg
This is a boutique hotel so be prepared for smaller rooms....we didn't mind this,neg
were initially surprised,neg
Very tight quarters for the money.,neg
Approximately 11'X11'  bedroom plus with a very adequate bathroom.,neg
Not as clean as I might expect for the money paid.,neg
Bed was not super comfortable nor the pillow selection.,neg
The gym is tiny.,neg
"2 x treadmills and one set of free weights, so just don't come here expecting to get any decent work outs in.",neg
Although we spent most of our days walking around extensively so hopefully that cancels out the need for a gym most days.,neg
"If you are a light sleeper room closest to elevator coud be a problem, otherwhise very quiet and relaxing.",neg
Tiny room.,neg
One power point as far from the bed as was possible.,neg
"SHEETS NOT CHANGED FORM PREVIOUS OCCUPANT
A/C so noisy impossible to sleep with in on.",neg
A wardrobe so small it was narrower than my suit hanger.,neg
Could not eben fit one suit in the wardrobe,neg
"Overall a great experience, the only (small) negative was ordering a pint while at the bar for $15 and getting a 12oz.",neg
But fully expect to pay more at in hotel bar.,neg
Rooms are small and cannot be suitable for three persons (adult) even if the hotel offers this opportunity.,neg
Size of the room.,neg
We were in a queen room and it was still very small.,neg
One single wardrobe to hand short items only and two extremely small drawers that just fitted my underwear in.,neg
No other space to unpack properly which was a shame in such a beautiful room.,neg
Surprisingly small room.,neg
"Staff was a mix between nice and helpful on one hand (reception), slow and unprofessional on the other hand (service, restaurant).",neg
"Cleaning was good,",neg
very late (not done when returning at 4 pm).,neg
Fitness area OK,neg
very small.,neg
Rooms fairly small,neg
to be honest we only slept there so given that the beds were so comfy it didn't really matter,neg
The beds were somewhere between a full and a queen and my husband and boys are tall.,neg
But even with that we slept great.,neg
Vey quiet room - no street noise.,neg
"bit more maintenance needed for the price - curtains in room need attention, shower door not closing,",neg
The rooms are quite small without ample space from belongings and toiletries.,neg
"Also, the lighting in our room was poor.",neg
Room much smaller than photograph.,neg
Bar and restaurant both closed for building works with no prior notification  or cost reduction .,neg
Air con noisy and woke me up all night.,neg
Noisy lift outside bedroom .,neg
Very small room.,neg
Service at breakfast poor with many items not available.,neg
Room service unreliable.,neg
No room service menu available because apparently being updated!,neg
pay for three and all services for two.,neg
"very small room, bathrobes for two, shower gel and shampoo for two, toilet paper for one, complimentary biscuits for two",neg
Apart from no mini bar in the room and the room slightly on the small side although I do appreciate that most hotel rooms in NYC are small.,neg
I can't fault the place .,neg
"The room itself is a bit small,",neg
very cozy!,neg
Rooms a bit small.,neg
We were 3 friends and we booked a room for 4 people to make sure we had enough space ...,neg
the room was really small.,neg
Beds are low.,neg
Shower should have a grab bar.,neg
Could use more light in the room.,neg
"breakfast - had to catch a shuttle so one of us asked for just a quick OJ and muffin...mini mini muffin, great OJ and the waiter put it in a to go cup,",neg
"the computer didn't come up, and he was the only one working tables a half hour into breakfast time?",neg
The lighting in the bedroom was poor and made it very difficult to read.,neg
On two occasions the towels in the bathroom had not been folded and put back on the towel rail.,neg
This is not acceptable in any hotel and certainly not a 4 star one.,neg
"I raised it with Management who were very apologetic, undertook to address it and offered us a complementary  breakfast.",neg
So I felt ithe issue was well handled.,neg
"Pictures online of double room seemed larger than reality -  we had expected the room to be small as all rooms small in NY however was tiny (Quite a squeeze for 2 women with suitcases & clothes for a week,",neg
we worked out a system & was adequate for our needs).,neg
"Free Wi-fi was appreciated, although extremely slow & sporadic (there was a paid option that we didn't try which may have been faster/stronger)",neg
"Room (Bedford Double - which we selected as there was no King Bed option only Queens in this hotel) was small (as expected for NYC) probably a little too small for a longer stay, and quite dark as no overhead lighting in centre of the room.",neg
Storage small and limited in both room and bathroom.,neg
Weren't informed restaurant was closed for renovations/rebranding - the smallish lobby was often busy and crowded due to people being seated in this area for drinks/meals during these renovations.,neg
"beautiful large shower, with great water pressure,",neg
wished there had been a bathtub.,neg
Our room was a little noisy and the house keeper kept forgetting things like no toilet paper..twice.,neg
The room was extreamly small.,neg
No closet to store clothes.,neg
it remain in the suitcase the entire stay.,neg
maybe a small bar with more choice in the lobby would have been good.,neg
"No bar or restaurant space--the few wine offerings were not very good, especially given the price.",neg
"They are renovating the restaurant so I imagine it will be more spacious and accommodating soon,",neg
"for the price, it was lacking.",neg
"Also-while the bed was comfortable, the bathroom had literally no counter space or anywhere to rest toiletries?!",neg
?,neg
The restaurant and the bar were under-going renovations.,neg
There was no indication this would be happening during our stay.,neg
"Very, very disappointed that no one advised of this.",neg
There was no reduction in price for lack of advertised facilities.,neg
This place has really deteriorated since it was taken over by another hotel group and had a name change.,neg
I have stayed four times in the last two years,neg
I won't be returning.,neg
The restaurant was being refurbished so you couldn't have breakfast there - they didn't tell you that when booking.,neg
Breakfast was in the lobby which was a little squashed to say the least.,neg
"You had to keep asking for your coffee to be topped up, the croissants were cold.",neg
The carpet in the lifts was dirty - and the lift takes forever -,neg
the worst thing was this: they offered to get me a cab to the airport.,neg
"This is more expensive than just getting a yellow cab, it was $65 dollars all in (including the toll charge).",neg
I waited over 30 minutes for them to get this for me and then I had to pay the toll charge - the driver said he wouldn't pay and that the hotel knew that and got a cut of the fare.,neg
"So, with a tip, the taxi ride to the airport was very expensive.",neg
This is not the kind of behaviour I expect from a first class hotel.,neg
It's shoddy.,neg
"Staff almost absent, not helpful at all.",neg
The room is too small-ok for one night stay,neg
not more.,neg
We got a room for people with disabilities and the shower was not draining properly so the bathroom was always covered in water.,neg
"Apparently these were the bigger rooms
There was a funny smell in the lobby and there wasn't enough natural light.",neg
It needs renovation.,neg
Overall we found it way too expensive for what it offered- we paid 350$/night incl.,neg
tax,neg
"bathroom shower head too high, drain was slow releasing water from showering.",neg
Some problem with mosquitos - might have been the shower problem.,neg
The room we were in was beyond acceptable in size.,neg
It was clearly a room for a queen/king bed (There was an outline for the headboard) that they squeezed two full beds into.,neg
It was not physically possible to sit in the chair at the desk because it was only about 1 foot from the bed.,neg
Really awful pillows!,neg
And the cleaning service each day was not that good.,neg
"For example, one day we had to repeatedly ask for the room to be cleaned and the bed made and the toiletries were not replenished unless requested.",neg
"The restaurant was being refurbished whilst we were there too, so there were tables set up in the lobby.",neg
No complaints.,neg
"It was a shame the restaurant was being refurbished during our stay,",neg
that's just bad timing.,neg
"Wine list changed during our stay, and none of the 4 white options were to our taste.",neg
I didn't like that there was no real restaurant due to a current renovation.,neg
I also didn't like that the late check out was at 12:00.,neg
The shower was impossible to turn on without getting wet.,neg
